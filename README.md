<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Imad 👋</h1>

I'm a passionate computer science student at 1337 Coding School pursuing a degree in Network Computer Science. 🎓

🚀 Currently exploring programming (C/C++), shell scripting, networking, graphics, and algorithms.

📚 I'm constantly enhancing my skills through hands-on experience and coursework provided by the renowned 42 Network. This immersive learning environment challenges me to solve real-world problems, collaborate with peers, and think critically.

🌟 My aspiration is to become a **Frontend Developer**. I believe in the power of elegant and user-friendly interfaces, and I'm excited to craft delightful web experiences.

🌐 Feel free to explore my repositories and projects to see what I'm currently working on.

Let's code, innovate, and make the digital world a better place together! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
